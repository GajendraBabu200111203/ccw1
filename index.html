            <a >As defined by UNICEF, Career Counselling / Career Guidance is a comprehensive, right-based development approach which is designed to assist individuals in making and implementing informed educational and occupational choices, which in turn lead to their
                social, financial and emotional well-being. Career Guidance is a process by which an adolescent makes a successful transition from school to higher education and finally into the workforce. The process involves exploring different
                careers, knowing the different pathways to careers, opportunities available, earning levels, and the time period required. Further it involves knowing one’s strengths and interest, matchmaking one’s own potential to the world of careers
                and then selecting the right courses and colleges, the process to apply and finally the ways to finance his/her education. iDreamCareer has a team of more than 898 stalwart career counselors working all across 105 districts of India.
