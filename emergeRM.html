                <p>
                    Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable
                    ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of
                    a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.

                    MACHINE LEARNING
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning
                    algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications,
                    such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, agriculture, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.[3][4] A subset of machine learning is closely
                    related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is statistical learning.

                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and infering
                     information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by animals and humans. 
                     Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer
                    vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
